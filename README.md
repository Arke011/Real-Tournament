Hi there, welcome to my first shooter game ever!

In this game, you will face a horde of zombies during many different waves. The guns are on the benches, use them :)

CONTROLS:

W - move forward;
S - move backward;
D - move to the right;
A - move to the left;

MOUSE1 - shoot!
R - reload;
Spacebar - jump;

You have 100 total health, each zombie hit will take away 10hp from you. Also, the guns do not have unlimited ammo, so be careful!
